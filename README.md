Data analysis and visualization exercise using Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) data set

The goal for this exercise is to replicate parts of Table 1 and Figure 1 from the following publication, using the associated, publicly available data set.    

*Source: Long-term Effects of Budesonide or Nedocromil in Children with Asthma by the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) Research Group published in N Engl J Med 2000;343:1054-63.*  

"The Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) was a clinical trial carried out in children with asthma. The trial was designed to determine the long-term effects of 3 treatments (budesonide, nedocromil, or placebo) on pulmonary function as measured by normalized FEV1 over a 5-6.5 year period."  

"Conclusions: In children with mild-to-moderate asthma, neither budesonide nor nedocromil is better than placebo in terms of lung function, but inhaled budesonide improves airway responsiveness and provides better control of asthma than placebo or nedocromil. The side effects of budesonide are limited to a small, transient reduction in growth velocity."  

A copy of the article, a modified data set for teaching, and its associated documentation have been provided for this exercise.
